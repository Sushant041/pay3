# *PayThree â€“ Payroll & ESOPs for the Andromeda Ecosystem*

Built for the Andromeda Hackathon: Automated DeFi Legos Track

## *Overview*

*PayThree* is a next-generation platform built natively for the *Andromeda ecosystem, designed to redefine how organizations manage global payroll and ESOPs using **Andromeda Digital Objects (ADOs)* and the *aOS framework*.

From a single, intuitive dashboard, organizations can *batch-process payouts* using Andromeda's Splitter ADO, guarantee *on-chain transparency* with every payment verifiable on blockchain explorers, automate *ESOP vesting* with Andromeda's Vesting ADO, send *instant email notifications* for payouts and stock option events, and enable *global, bank-free settlements* in secondsâ€”all while leveraging Andromeda's composable, modular ADO infrastructure.

With PayThree, payroll isn't just faster and more efficientâ€”it's automated, verifiable, and built for the next generation of work using Andromeda's intelligent DeFi building blocks.

## *Hackathon Submission: Automated DeFi Legos*

PayThree perfectly embodies the *Automated DeFi Legos* track by combining multiple Andromeda ADOs to create intelligent, automated financial workflows for payroll and equity management. Our solution demonstrates how aOS and modular ADOs can create truly intelligent money management systems.
